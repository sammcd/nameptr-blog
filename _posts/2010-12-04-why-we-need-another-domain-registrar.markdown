Todays web hosting environment has changed, and we are in need of a new 
domain registrar, one that focuses on usability and is the perfect companion to today's cloud 
hosting solutions.  [nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com) is my answer to that need.


### The perfect companion to todays' cloud hosting

In the world of the web app, shared hosting simply doesn't make since anymore. 

### Viewing the registrar as an app, not a shopping cart

domain sharing, domain search.

conclusion: todays environment is an exciting one for registrars

### Caring about users

Today's registrars compete on price. [nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com)'s goal will be to compete not 
on price, but the user's experience.

After logging into a domain registrar you are usually greeted with a mess of options. Since today's
registrars sell everything from hosting to html site builders, there are many options that a 
domain buyer simply doesn't need. Most registrars require quite a few clicks after logging in before
the user can see their list of domains. By focusing just on domains and ssl certificates 
[nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com) will allow you to find and update the information you need quicker. 



Since registrars play the price game, they are forced to find other ways to increase their profits.
The most popular way of doing this is by up selling. Often it means registrars try to sell you things
like "business listings", which provide no actual value to the customer. Another common upsell is 
web hosting, which does actually provide a value. However with today's move to cloud hosting
providers like Linode, Slicehost, and Amazon EC2 it usually makes little since to buy the shared
hosting provided by your domain registrar.
