title: Why we need another domain registrar
layout: post
---

Todays web hosting environment has changed, and we are in need of a new 
domain registrar, one that focuses on usability and is the perfect companion to today's cloud 
hosting solutions.  [nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com) is my answer to that need.


### The perfect companion to today's cloud hosting

In the world of the web app, shared hosting simply doesn't make sense. The future is 
filled with VPS's and services like Heroku. It makes little sense for your
name registrar to also be your hosting provider. You need one solid place for your names and you 
need the ability to easily and quickly point them to different servers and services. 

### Viewing the registrar as an app, not a shopping cart

At [nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com) we view our registrar as an application. This means that 
instead of focusing on adding services and charges we will be focusing on ways to make your 
experience better.

There are many application-style features
that fit perfectly in this space that no one is doing. First there is name sharing. It very 
common that a developer needs to configure changes on a domain that someone else owns. What
if the registrar had a way of sharing a domain's configuration between people? I also think
there is much room for improvement in finding domains, and buying and configuring ssl certificates.

### Caring about users

Today's registrars compete on price. [nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com)'s goal will not be to compete 
on price, but on the user's experience.

After logging into a domain registrar, you are usually greeted with lots of options. Since today's
registrars sell everything from hosting to html site builders, there are many options that a 
domain buyer simply doesn't want. Most registrars require quite a few clicks after logging in before
the user can see their list of domains. By focusing just on domains and ssl certificates 
[nameptr.com](http://nameptr.com) will allow you to find and update the information you need 
much quicker. 


Since most registrars play the price game, they are forced to find other ways to increase their profits.
The most popular way of doing this is by up selling. Often it means registrars try to sell you things
like "business listings," which provide no actual value to the customer.

With today's move to cloud storage providers, and people rethinking how a name provider should work, 
today
is a very exciting time to enter the domain registrar space, and we hope to provide a refreshing
alternative to today's domain registrars.
